# Team, todo-list and budget
## 1- DApp development
We want to make a wallet-to-wallet instant messanger similar to `scan.blockscan.com`, but something different:
* Using `gunDB` as decentralized database. Refer to `https://gun.eco/`, and `https://github.com/fireship-io/gun-chat`.
* Using `react/moralis` as web3 library.
* Support mult-chain(Ethereum, BSC, Polygon etc.)
* Using Material UI(mui) will be great, refer to: http://bootstrap.gallery/ichat/landing/index.html
* budget: `20k-25k` from `gitcoin`

## 2- Landing website

* Simple and web3 styled landing page
* Including `Donation` model
* Tech: React
* budget: `5k` from `gitcoin`

## 3- NFTs & marketplace

  * NFT & Mystery Box contracts
  * Marketplace contract
